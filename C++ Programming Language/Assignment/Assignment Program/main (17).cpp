/*Que 3: POP vs. OOP Comparison Program

o Write two small programs: one using Procedural Programming (POP) to calculate the
area of a rectangle, and another using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a
class and object for the same task.

o Objective: Highlight the difference between POP and OOP approaches.*/
